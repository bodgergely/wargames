0040A049: start of unpacker code execution

This unpacker will unpack:
	- 401000 - 405000: to be unpacked
	- 406000 - 409000: to be unpacked

After unpacking the mem regions and loading the kernel32.dll functions into a table we jump to the decoded entry point.

40A1FB jumps to 401150
401150 entry point.



401000 is the Windows loop. This is where we set up the callback to messages.

Our callback is at 401110.


The original entry point is at 00401150 and that is our solution!
