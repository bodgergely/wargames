Need to resize the terminal window you are connecting from to a few characters of height so we
can enter into scrolling mode!!

After that hit 'v' to enter vi mode (/usr/bin/vi will be forked)

in vim:
:set shell=/bin/bash
!/bin/bash

Voila. We broke out of 'more'. 

Now we can resize the terminal back.

Congratulations on solving the last level of this game!

At this moment, there are no more levels to play in this game. However, we are constantly working
on new levels and will most likely expand this game with more levels soon.
Keep an eye out for an announcement on our usual communication channels!
In the meantime, you could play some of our other wargames.

If you have an idea for an awesome new level, please let us know!
