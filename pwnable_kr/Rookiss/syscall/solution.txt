See page 24 in: A Guide to Kernel Exploitation Attacking the Core.pdf.

Vulnerability:

Syscall which copies our data to the location where we want does not do any checking on the supplied addresses.

We could overwrite the return address on the kernel stack with the address of our user land defined function which would contain the 'malicious' code (to read the contents of /root/flag).
Not sure how to figure out that address of the stack...

Another option is to look for some kernel memory that is fixed at compile time and writable and is useful for us.


Or maybe the syscall table is writable! The syscall.c file says that thessycall table has been remapped to be writable. So basically we could just register our own function address I guess.


0x8000e348(syscall table start) + 223(SYS_NR)*4(ptr size) is the location.


1)Remapping the whole code section of our application code
2)Calculate offset of our exploit code (read_file) and add it to the base address f the remapped executable code section and overwrite the syscall table entry 223 with that address
3) We can not use syscalls from kernel mode so we need to use the kernel functions.
We should lookup the kernel addresses of these functions and use their addresses in our application code to invoke them.

GDB
===

- Run the kernel on qemu with gdb server (-s) enabled 
- Connect with gdb (gdb ~/busybox/build/linux/vmlinux) from the host machine
./gdb vmlinux
(gdb) target remote localhost:1234
(gdb) b do_fast_syscall_32
(gdb) b __se_sys_openat     // first function called by the syscall handler to open file
(gdb) b /home/geri/workspace/linux/arch/x86/entry/common.c:320 if nr == 223
(gdb) b *0x21232539     // read_file - instr after the memset
(gdb) b do_sys_open
(gdb) b *0xc11920f0      // do_filp_open
(gdb) b *0xc11a1bfb      // link_path_walk
(gdb) b *0xc11a0917
(gdb) b *0xc11a05ff
(gdb) b *0xc119e9b5
(gdb) b inode_permission
(gdb) b generic_permission  // fs/namei.c


Modifying the credentials for the current process approach (WORKS!!!)
==========================================================

After installing into the sys_call_table our callback function - the callback function could change the credentials for our process?

see: linux/kernel/cred.c


1) struct cred *prepare_creds(void)
2) int commit_creds(struct cred *new)   // will install the supplied struct cred* into the current process

(x86 kernel addresses below)

c10720e0 T prepare_creds
c1071ed0 T commit_creds

Also overwrite the fields(linux/include/cred.h) the allocated cred structure we got by prepare_cred with the id 0 (root id). First field is usage count then the next 8 u32 fields are id fields. Overwrite them with 0.

Let's try this now.

This worked!!!!
Look at exploit_arm.c

Needs around 64 bytes to store the flag data.

Run:

./exploit 555950370


Flag: Congratz!! addr_limit looks quite IMPORTANT now... huh?
