<geri> Is it possible to stay in the shell interactively in vortex1? I know there is a hint to look at how bash handles EOF.
<b0bb> so one of you tell morla and then let us consider this mystery solved
<b0bb> lets also agree that nobody likes asm pastes, not even gizmore
<geri> I an solve it when "-i" is passed...
<b0bb> yes you can keep it interactive
<gizmore> actually i tried to read it but did not understand the mapping ASM => machinecode.... then i gave up
<geri> ok sorry about the asm :)
<b0bb> its pushing a NULL and two strings and calling a function
<b0bb> so 3 args to a function
<b0bb> geri, there are a few tricks to do what you are asking to do, and the EOF hint is everything you need
<geri> the here document?
<b0bb> not heredoc

<geri> I have struggled with this for a day now, I really hate tty
<geri> thanks!
<geri> good to have a hint, thanks b0bb
<b0bb> sure
<b0bb> its good to read the whole thing but if you are lazy and just scan it, what you need is in there
<b0bb> good luck
