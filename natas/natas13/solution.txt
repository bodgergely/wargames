Since the content is checked by exif_imagetype we need to put 12 bytes of image
signature before the html+php code payload.
By looking at the php interpreter source code of the metnioned function we
can see it is checking the first 12 bytes of the file and decides if the file is image or not
based on that.


1) have .php the extension of the random gen filename
2) from a random jpg file grab the first 12 bytes and put it before our html+php payload
